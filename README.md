# Groovy Workshop

In our opinion you only learn languages if you play with them. Only consuming PowerPoint presentations isn't enough.
So this workshop will allow you to learn Groovy syntax and concepts by making testcases pass. 

Please note that this workshop is heavily inspired by the [Groovy Koans](http://groovykoans.org/),
but provides a slightly different structure and scope.  

## Workshop Requirements
- Download and extract [Gradle 2.0](https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.0-bin.zip)

## Optional (but recommended)
- Download and extract [Groovy 2.3.3](http://dl.bintray.com/groovy/maven/groovy-binary-2.3.3.zip)
- Download and install [IntelliJ 13 CE](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

(Groovy 2.3.3 already comes as jar-file in the `/lib` folder)

## Remove solutions
Before you start the workshop please remove the solutions in the code.
Just execute

    gradle clean removeSolutions
    
The solutions for the tests are copied into `output/solutions`.
